IMAGE EXPLANED
1.in rgb colour model there are three bands in 1 PIXEL=> RED(0-255) GREEN(0-255) BLUE(0-255)
2.every colour is represented by rbg models with different band values.
3.EACH BAND HAS SIZE OF 1 BITS. MEANS 1 PIXEL HAS 3 BITS

Q- HOW WE ARE EMBEDDING DOCUMENT IN AN IMAGE?
ANS --WE USE THE BENIFET OF HUMAN EYE  NOT RESOLUTION OF TWO CLOSE PIXELS COLOURS.
STEPS:-
  1.WE CONVERT DECIMAL INTO BINARY 8 DIGETS.
   2. WE BREAK BINARY NUMBER INTO (3,3,2) PARTS FIRST RED,SECOND GREEN,THIRD BLUE.
   3. WE PUT UP A PIXEL AND WRITE DOWN 3 COLOUR BAND OF IT.
   4. THEN CONVERT PIXEL RGB BAND (0-255) DECIMAL VALUES INTO BINARY.
    5. REPLACE LAST (3,3,2)BINARY DIGITS OF RGB BY NUMBER(3,3,2) BINARY DIGITS.
     6. THEN CONVERT THIS MODIFIED BINARY INTO DECIMAL. THEN RGB VALUES WILL CHANGE SLIGHTLY COMBINE RGB AND MAKE PIXEL COLOUR.
  7. IT WILL BE SLIGHTLY SIMILAR TO PREVIUS COLOUR THAT OUR EYE NOT RESOLVED AND THAT PROCESS WE EMBEDDED DOCUMENT INTO IMAGE PIXELS.
