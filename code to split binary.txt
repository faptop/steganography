# how to split binary of any decimal number into (red,green,blue)
# we will use and operator ref to image 1
#  we use AND operator (11) for 2 bit and (111) for 3 bits bec. AND (1) always give same 
# number which is AND with (11) or (111)...
def split(data):
    blue_bit= data & 0x3 # we use decimal 3-->(11) binary form ---> 0x3 hexadecimal form
    # we use hexadecimal bec. AND operator work in hexadecimal only...
    #here blue_bit come in a decimal number form itself which is (0)
    #loose 2 bits
    data= data >> 2
    # we right shift by 2 to delete blue binary two bits and make green 3 last bits
    green_bit =data & 0x7 # here we use decimal 7--->(111) binary form --->0x7 hexa.
    # here green_bit comes in a decimal form (2)
    #loose 3 bits
    red_bit=data >> 3
    return [red_bit,green_bit,blue_bit]
    # for 1 line  return[ data>>5 ,((data>>2) & 0x7), (data & 0x3)]
print(split(ord('h'))) #here ord() will  make ASCII value of 'h' --> decimal number form--->104
